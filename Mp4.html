    <h1>I really want to stay at your house<br>-Let's eat grandma</h1>
    <p>
        <br><br><b>Verse 1</b><br>
        I couldn't wait for you to come and clear the cupboard<br>
        But now you're gone and leaving nothing but a sign<br>
        <i>Another evening I'll be sitting reading in between your lines<br>
            Because I miss you all the time<br></i>

        <br><br><b>Pre Chorus</b><br>
        <i>So, get away<br>
            Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know<br>
            And let yourself go<br>
            You know you didn't lose your self-control<br>
            Let's start at the rainbow<br>
            Turn away<br>
            Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go<br>
            And let yourself go<br>
            Is that a compromise?<br></i>

        <br><br><b>Chorus</b><br>
        So, what do you wanna do, what's your point of view?<br>
        There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?<br>
        A handshake with you, what's your point of view?<br>
        I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go<br>
        <i>Cause I really wanna stay at your house<br>
            And I hope it all works out<br>
            But you know how much you broke me apart<br>
            I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you<br>
            I don't wanna know, ahh<br></i>

        <br><br><b>Verse 2</b><br>
        <i>And I'm aware that you were lying in the gutter<br>
            Cause I did everything to be there by your side-ide<br>
            So when you tell me I'm the reason, I just can't believe the lies<br>
            And why do I still wanna call you (call you, call you, call you)<br></i>

        <br><br><b>Chorus</b><br>
        So, what do you wanna do, what's your point of view?<br>

            I don't wanna know<br></i>

        <br><br><b>Bridge</b><br>
        Ohh<br>
        oh-oh, oh-oh-oh<br>
        I don't know why I'm no one<br>
